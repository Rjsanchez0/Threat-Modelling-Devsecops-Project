# Attack 1: Credential Stuffing Attack
##

##  Stages of the Attack


### Origins
The attack begins with cybercriminals obtaining a database of compromised credentials from previous data breaches. These credentials are often sourced from dark web forums or publicly leaked databases. The motivation is financial gain, aiming to exploit user accounts for unauthorized access.

### Reconnaissance
Attackers conduct reconnaissance to identify potential targets within CloudVista Solutions. They analyze login endpoints, such as https://payfast.cloudvista.com/login, and investigate APIs or web interfaces for authentication. Tools like Burp Suite or custom scripts may be used to detect weaknesses, such as the absence of rate limiting or ineffective CAPTCHA mechanisms.

### Weaponization
With reconnaissance complete, attackers prepare by compiling credential databases from breach sources. They create automated tools, such as Python scripts or credential stuffing frameworks like Sentry MBA, to execute brute-force login attempts. The tools are configured with the endpoint details, login parameters, and proxies to evade detection.

### Delivery
The attack is delivered through bots that send thousands of login requests to CloudVista’s authentication system. Exploiting misconfigured APIs or the lack of bot protection, the attackers target the /login endpoint with rapid automated attempts to match credentials.

### Exploitation
Successful login attempts occur when the stolen credentials match existing accounts. The attackers exploit weaknesses in the authentication process, such as accounts without MFA, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

### Installation
Once inside the compromised accounts, attackers establish persistence by updating recovery details like email addresses or phone numbers. This ensures legitimate users are locked out. Attackers may also create fraudulent payment links or transactions tied to their own accounts.

### Action on Objectives
The final phase involves achieving the attack’s objectives. The attackers transfer funds from user accounts to their own, exfiltrate sensitive PII or transaction data for resale, and potentially disrupt CloudVista’s reputation by leaking stolen credentials or conducting fraudulent transactions.
