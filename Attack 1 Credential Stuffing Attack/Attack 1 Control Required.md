## Attack 1 Control Requirements: Credential Stuffing
To mitigate the risks associated with credential stuffing, the following control requirements should be implemented across CloudVista Solutions' systems and processes. These controls align with best practices for securing authentication systems  and mitigating brute-force attacks.
##

### 1. Authentication Controls
**Control Requirement: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).**
- All user accounts must require MFA to add an additional layer of security beyond passwords.
- MFA should support modern standards such as TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator) or push notifications.

**Control Requirement: Enforce strong password policies.**
- Require complex passwords with minimum length, character diversity, and no reuse of breached passwords.
- Integrate a password blacklist mechanism to reject commonly used or breached passwords.

**Control Requirement: Implement account lockout and CAPTCHA.**
- Lock accounts temporarily after a predefined number of failed login attempts.
- Use CAPTCHA challenges after multiple failed login attempts to prevent automated attacks.
##

### 2. Monitoring and Detection Controls

**Control Requirement: Implement anomaly detection.**
- Use behavior analytics to identify unusual login patterns, such as excessive failed attempts from a single IP or geographic location.
- Flag or block login attempts originating from known malicious 
IP addresses.

**Control Requirement: Monitor login endpoint activity.**
- Collect and analyze logs for login requests, including timestamps, IP addresses, and user agents.
- Set alerts for unusual spikes in login attempts or traffic to authentication endpoints.
##

## 3. Access and API Controls

**Control Requirement: Enforce rate limiting on authentication endpoints.**

- Configure rate limiting to restrict the number of login attempts allowed per IP or user account within a given time period.
- Apply exponential backoff to further slow repeated failed login attempts.

**Control Requirement: Secure authentication APIs.**

- Ensure all API requests are transmitted over HTTPS.
- Require OAuth2 tokens or API keys for accessing authentication services.
- Validate all input parameters to prevent tampering.
## 

## 4. Awareness and Incident Response Controls

**Control Requirement: Notify users of unusual account activity.**
- Send automated alerts to users for failed login attempts, suspicious login locations, or new device logins.
- Provide mechanisms for users to report unauthorized access attempts.

**Control Requirement: Implement a credential breach detection system.**

- Regularly scan leaked credential databases and notify users if their credentials are found in a breach.
- Force password resets for affected accounts.

**Control Requirement: Develop and test incident response plans.**

- Create a playbook for responding to credential stuffing incidents, including isolating affected systems, analyzing attack patterns, and notifying impacted users.
- Conduct regular tabletop exercises to test response readiness.
## 

## 5. Infrastructure Controls

**Control Requirement: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).**

- Deploy a WAF to block automated login attempts and bot traffic.
- Configure WAF rules to identify and block credential stuffing patterns.

**Control Requirement: Use geolocation-based restrictions.**

- Restrict access to authentication endpoints from high-risk regions or countries where CloudVista Solutions does not operate.
