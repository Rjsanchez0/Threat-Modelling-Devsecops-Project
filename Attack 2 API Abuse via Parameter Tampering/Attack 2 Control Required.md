# Control Requirements Explanation

## **1. Authentication**
- **Why It’s Needed**: Proper authentication ensures that only authorized users and systems can access the API endpoints. Without strong authentication, attackers can send malicious requests to APIs.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use OAuth2 for API authentication.
  - Issue tokens with granular scopes to control access to specific API resources.
  - Rotate API keys and tokens regularly to reduce the risk of abuse.

## **2. Input Validation**
- **Why It’s Needed**: Input validation prevents attackers from tampering with parameters in API requests to execute unauthorized actions or access restricted data.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use server-side validation to verify the integrity of all input parameters.
  - Reject invalid, unexpected, or out-of-range parameter values (e.g., negative transaction amounts).
  - Implement schema validation for JSON or XML input.

## **3. Access Controls**
- **Why It’s Needed**: Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts API access based on the user’s role and permissions, minimizing the risk of unauthorized actions.
- **Implementation**:
  - Define roles (e.g., admin, user, read-only) and assign minimal privileges.
  - Verify user permissions for every API request using role-based policies.
  - Log access attempts and alert administrators on policy violations.

## **4. Monitoring**
- **Why It’s Needed**: Continuous monitoring helps detect and respond to unusual API usage patterns, such as tampered parameters or a high volume of requests from a single IP address.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use API monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Datadog) to track request patterns.
  - Set up alerts for anomalies, such as unexpected parameter values or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Retain logs for forensic analysis in case of incidents.

## **5. Rate Limiting**
- **Why It’s Needed**: Rate limiting prevents attackers from overwhelming the API with a large volume of requests, which could lead to exploitation or denial-of-service conditions.
- **Implementation**:
  - Limit the number of API requests per user or IP address within a defined time window.
  - Implement exponential backoff for repeated failed requests.
  - Use API gateways (e.g., AWS API Gateway) to enforce rate-limiting policies.

## **6. Encryption**
- **Why It’s Needed**: Encryption protects API traffic from being intercepted or tampered with during transmission, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Implementation**:
  - Enforce HTTPS for all API endpoints.
  - Use strong TLS configurations to secure data in transit.
  - Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials or transaction details.
